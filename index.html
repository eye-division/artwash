    <p>This site provides information about <span class="red">ArtWash</span> activities, including our past, present and future news. </p>

      <p><span class="red">ArtWash</span> is an artist led association that makes art and events happen. <span class="red">ArtWash</span> was founded in 2003 by Kay Sentence; joined later by Barry Reeves and Ann Rapstoff. <span class="red">ArtWash</span> has been providing a platform for artists to present experimental work in progress and completed work in unconventional spaces and contexts. It makes links with artists and supports them in presenting their work. The <span class="red">ArtWash</span> team have worked in the South East with regional national and international artists. <span class="red">&nbsp;ArtWash</span> audiences are usually small and intimate; the team offers artists feedback and supports dialogue concerning the development of work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span class="red">ArtWash</span> has showcased diverse work in a working laundrette, including, performance, installation, dance, poetry, installation, sonic art and participatory happenings. More recently <span class="red">ArtWash</span> developed Take-out a one night happening at Tsang&rsquo;s Kitchen and Home Delivery Service, in which&nbsp; &lsquo;the customer&rsquo; chose an artist from a menu and provided their home as a venue for the work.&nbsp; <br />
